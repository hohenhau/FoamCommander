/* ------------------------ Solver Options & Notes ------------------------- *\
solver - The algorithm to solve the linear system of equations (matrices) for a 
field. Symmetric matrices (A = transpose(A)) are for diffusion-like terms, while 
non-symmetric matrices are for turbulence & velocity. Common solver option are:
   - GAMG = Geometric-Algebraic MultiGrid - usually used for Pressure
   - smoothSolver = Smoothed solver - fast/fragile compared to PBiCG
   - PBiCG = Preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient - slow/robust 
   - PCG = Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (only for symmetric matrices)

smoother - Technique (for GAMG and smoothSolver) to reduce local errors during 
each iteration by smoothing the solution field. Common options are:
   - DIC = Diagonal-based incomplete Cholesky - good for symmetric GAMG - fast & somewhat robust
   - DICGaussSeidel = Combination of DIC GaussSeidel
   - GaussSeidel = Classic Gauss-Seidel - good for non-symmetri smoothSolver - slower but more robust
   - symGaussSeidel = Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (good for smoothSolver) - somewhat robust

preconditioner - Matrix-based technique transforming the a system of equations into an 
equivalent one that is better *conditioned* and easier to solve. Common options are:
   - DILU = Diagonal-based incomplete LU - good for non-symmetric matrices - fast & robust
   - FDIC = Fast Diagonal-based Incomplete Cholesky - good for symmetic PCG - faster than DIC

tolerance - is the absolute residual below which a solution for a variable
is considered converged for a single solver iteration

relTol - The relative tolerance stops the solver if the residual drop is small 
compared to the initial residual of that iteration. To ignore set "relTol 0;"

SIMPLE Algorithm - Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations
PISO Algortihm   - Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operator
PIMPLE Algorithm - Combination of PISO and SIMPLE algorithms

nOuterCorrectors - Outer loops to couple *all* equations. A value of 1 replicates PISO. 
Higher values enable iterative corrections for better convergence in strongly-coupled 
(i.e. turbulent) systems but also increase computational cost. Increase beyond 2 if 
the case involves strong coupling between equations or challenging turbulence models

nCorrectors - Inner loops to couple *momentum-pressure* equations. It increases the 
accuracy of pressure-velocity coupling by solving the pressure equation multiple times.

residualControl - Only applicable to some solvers, including GAMG and PBICG

}
/* ---------------------- Relaxation Options & Notes ----------------------- *\
Relaxation Factors can be between 0 and 1. 1 means the solution fully updates
with each step, O means the simulation does not update at all (not practical), 
and a value beteen 0 and 1 blends the previous and current simulation. Lower
factors increase stability but reduce rate of convergence. Typical values are
between 0.3 and 0.7 for steady state solutions, but transient solutions often 
use a value of 1.0 for faster convergence.
